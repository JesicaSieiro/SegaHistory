                          <p>Bromley sent Richard Stewart, a Service Games salesman, and Raymond Lemaire, a mechanic, to Japan to expand sales on U.S. military reservations. This led to the creation of Service Games, Japan, and over the next few years, a network of factories was established across Southeast Asia to cater to American troops. Service Games also began selling machines in Europe, becoming a major player in the worldwide slot machine market.

Rosen's company found success importing coin-operated instant photo booths from America, catering to the Japanese need for photographic ID cards.

The company continued to use the "Sega" brand, releasing the first original product to bear the name, the Sega 1000 jukebox, in 1960.</p>

By 1987, Sega operated 40,000 coin-operated machines in 2,000 locations worldwide. The late 1980s also saw Sega reassert itself in the amusement operations sector with the Hi-Tech Land Sega and Hi-Tech Sega game center chains in Japan, as well as the Time-Out venues in the USA.</p>

Strong marketing, new company recruits like Tom Kalinske, and cutting-edge technology helped the Mega Drive outpace Nintendo in most of the world, creating one of the most memorable "console wars" of all time.</p>

                            <p>By 1991, Sega was selling products in over 44 countries and employing 1,695 people, expanding despite Japan's bubble economy bursting. Sega's new mascot, Sonic the Hedgehog, played a significant role in the company's success, particularly in the American and European markets.</p>
                            <p>In the arcades, Sega innovated with titles like Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter, powered by the Model 1 board, and the Mega Visor Display used in the VR-1 attraction. Sega's network of facilities included Sega World and GiGO chains in Japan and GameWorks centers in the Americas. Sega's ambition to become the Japanese equivalent of Disney saw the launch of Amusement Theme Parks, with plans for 100 indoor theme parks by 2000. Flagship locations included Tokyo Joypolis, SegaWorld London, and Sega World Sydney.</p>
                            <p>However, the Sega Mega-CD and Sega 32X's lukewarm receptions, internal politics, and competition from the PlayStation strained Sega's home consumer division. Despite successes in the arcades with the Model 2 and 3, attendance at Sega's amusement centers declined, and the supporting infrastructure failed. By the late 1990s, Sega faced continuous financial losses, closed hundreds of amusement centers, and placed its hopes in the Sega Dreamcast and Sega NAOMI arcade hardware. Although popular among fans, these products were not enough to reverse Sega's fortunes, leading to a planned merger with Bandai being pulled and the company downsizing significantly.</p>

This series primarily spanned from 1983 to 1992 and was succeeded by the Sega Model series. The defining characteristic of the Sega System hardware was the use of an 8-bit Zilog Z80 chip, initially as the main CPU and later for sound handling.</p>

                    <h2>SG-1000</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is the first gaming system that Sega dedicated for home consumers. It was only released in Asia and Oceania, having enough sales to convincing Sega to continue developing video games for home.
                        It had a white/grey simplistic design, with a top-loading cartridge and one wired controller. However, it was able to handle a second controller connected by a DE-9 port.
                        
                    </p>
                    <h3>Controllers:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The first controller (model SJ-200) is hard-wired into the unit, making it difficult to replace.</li>
                        <li>A second controller can be connected via a DE-9 port on the right side of the console</li>
                        <li>Sega later released an adapter cable (JC-100) that allowed the use of standard detachable controllers, effectively replacing the hard-wired joystick.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Internal Hardware:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The SG-1000 shares a largely identical hardware setup with the ColecoVision, but it features a faster VRAM chip made by Fujitsu.</li>
                        <li>These hardware similarities explain the compatibility between the Telegames Personal Arcade, ColecoVision, and SG-1000, and also facilitate the unofficial porting of SG-1000 games to the ColecoVision.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>SC-3000 Comparison:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The SC-3000, the computer counterpart to the SG-1000, shares the same hardware but includes more program RAM.</li>
                        <li>Both the SG-1000 and SC-3000 are comparable to the original MSX standard, which also has more program RAM.</li>
                        <li>Several MSX games have been ported to the SG-1000 in Taiwan and South Korea due to this hardware similarity.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Design and Usability:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Despite its appearance, the SG-1000 is a much flatter console than expected, with its unique shape and aesthetics giving the impression of a taller system.</li>
                        <li>The SJ-200 controller is often criticized for being stiff and unresponsive, and if it breaks, replacing it is challenging.</li>
                        <li>Future Sega consoles addressed this issue by allowing both controllers to be removable.</li>
                        <li>The SK-1100 keyboard can be plugged into the back of the SG-1000, enhancing its capabilities and aligning it more closely with the SC-3000.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Comparative Power:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The SG-1000 and SC-3000 are roughly on par with the original MSX standard and comparable to the Commodore 64 in terms of hardware capabilities.</li>
                        <li>However, they are not as powerful as Nintendo's Famicom/NES, which was a significant competitor during that era.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="experience-section-content segaMasterSystem">
                    <h2>SEGA MASTER SYSTEM</h2>
                    <p>
                        Sega was going through a big pressure at the time, especially with products like the MSX or Nintendo’s Family Computer. Likewise, they managed to release the Sega Master System, a big improvement compared to its previous console.
                        Anyway, sales didn’t go as well as expected due to Nintendo’s dominance of Japanese market.
                        The Master System is essentially a rebadged Sega Mark III and shares most of the same traits as Sega's earlier console. Like the Mark III and SG-1000, it is designed to play video games distributed on ROM cartridges (or Sega Cards) through a compatible television.
                        
                    </p>
                    <h3>Compatibility:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The hardware builds on the design of the SG-1000, making it completely backwards compatible with the older console.</li>
                        <li>While technically capable of a degree of SC-3000 support, no versions of the Master System were ever designed with the ability to expand into a home computer.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Technical Specifications:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>CPU: The Master System uses a Zilog Z80 CPU, which has an 8-bit data bus with both 8-bit and 16-bit registers.</li>
                        <li>Graphics Processor (VDP): The system features an 8/16-bit graphics processor with a 16-bit data bus and both 8-bit and 16-bit registers.</li>
                        <li>This combination of an 8-bit CPU with a 16-bit graphics processor was innovative and a precursor to the PC Engine (TurboGrafx-16), a more powerful console that was released in 1987 and began the 16-bit era, leading to the creation of the Sega Mega Drive (Genesis).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Media Format:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Master System uses ROM cartridges and Sega Cards to distribute games. These media formats allowed for relatively easy and quick game distribution and swapping.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Backward Compatibility:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Master System's design allows it to play games from the SG-1000, showcasing Sega's commitment to supporting their previous hardware and game library.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Hybrid Design:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Master System's hybrid 8/16-bit architecture set a new standard in the gaming industry, paving the way for the next generation of consoles. This design approach allowed Sega to provide more advanced graphics and gameplay experiences compared to purely 8-bit systems.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        The Mega Drive development started pretty soon after the release of the Master System.
                        As usual, they built the console on previous existing hardware for reducing the manufacturing cost and make the software backwards compatible.
                        The “Mark V” design was focused on efficiency.

                    </p>
                    <h3>Technological Advancements:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>CPU: The Mega Drive uses the Motorola 68000, a 16-bit CPU that was already popular in arcade machines and home computers by the mid-1980s. This choice was intended to deliver superior performance and capabilities compared to the 8-bit systems.</li>
                        <li>Backward Compatibility: The Mega Drive builds on the technology found in the Master System and, with the use of adaptors, is fully backward compatible, allowing users to play their existing library of Master System games.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Key Features and Innovations:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Control Pad: The Mega Drive introduced an ergonomically designed control pad with three face buttons (A, B, and C), an improvement over the two-button controllers of previous consoles.</li>
                        <li>Stereo Sound: Unlike its competitors, the Mega Drive outputs sound in stereo, enhancing the audio experience for players.</li>
                        <li>Region Locking: The console makes an attempt to region-lock games through software, a feature aimed at controlling game distribution and compatibility across different regions.</li>
                        <li>Visual Output: With the right cables, the Mega Drive can produce a clearer image than its rivals, taking advantage of its higher resolution 320x240 display.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Design and Usability:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Top-Loading Cartridge Design: The Mega Drive features a top-loading design, which was more convenient and user-friendly compared to the VCR-style cartridge loading of the Western NES.</li>
                        <li>Removable Controllers: Unlike the Famicom, the Mega Drive's controllers are removable, providing greater flexibility and ease of use.</li>
                        <li>Hardware Expansion: The Mega Drive was designed from the beginning to support hardware expansions, allowing for future upgrades and additional functionality.</li>
                        <li>Durability: The console's use of dark plastic minimizes the issue of "yellowing" over time, which was common with older systems due to bromine-based flame retardants reacting with oxygen.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="experience-section-content segaGameGear">
                    <h2>SEGA GAME GEAR</h2>
                    <p>
                        It was released in 1990 as a response to Nintendo’s Game Boy. It is Sega’s first attempt to compete in the handheld games market.
                        Sega tried to improve and solve some hardware problems of the Game Boy for the Game Gear, as for example, adjusting the design for greater hand comfort or applying a colour LCD screen.

                    </p>
                    <h3>Design and Usability:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Form Factor: The Game Gear is held lengthwise at the sides, a design choice intended to prevent hand cramping, which was a common issue with the Game Boy.</li>
                        <li>Screen: It features a backlit, color LCD screen, providing clearer and more vibrant visuals than its main rival, the Game Boy.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Technical Specifications:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Derived from Master System: The Game Gear is largely derived from the Sega Master System. The primary differences include:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>VDP (Video Display Processor): Capable of displaying palettes with a wider variety of colors.</li>
                            <li>Stereo Sound: Offers stereo sound playback, enhancing the audio experience.</li>
                            <li>Resolution: While Game Gear games typically run at a smaller resolution, the device is capable of playing games in higher resolutions due to its screen design.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Controls:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Buttons: The Game Gear features a D-Pad and two primary buttons (1 and 2), similar to the Master System, and adds a third button, START. This is one button short of the Game Boy's control scheme.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Power and Portability:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Batteries: The Game Gear requires six AA batteries for portable use. The backlit LCD screen, however, consumes a lot of power, leading to a battery life of only three to five hours. A battery pack is available to extend playtime.</li>
                        <li>Heat: The system generates more heat than the Game Boy, often causing "sweaty palms" after prolonged use.</li>
                        <li>Size: The Game Gear is bulkier than the Game Boy, making it less portable as it does not fit easily in many pockets.</li>
                        <li>AC Adaptor: An AC adaptor can be used to power the Game Gear from a wall outlet, though this was not a practical solution for most consumers.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Durability Issues:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Capacitor Problems: Game Gears were manufactured during a period when capacitor problems were common in the electronics industry. As a result, screen and audio failures are frequent, and repairs are often complicated.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="experience-section-content segaMegaCd">
                    <h2>SEGA MEGA-CD</h2>
                    <p>
                        At this moment, Sega was intending to release add-ons to the Mega Drive.
                        They finally decided to make a CD-Rom upgrade to the Mega Drive called Mega-CD. It was intended to have 2-4 megabits of RAM, but it finally ended up receiving 6 Mb.
                        The development of MEGA-CD was a closely guarded secret, but it finally was revealed at the Tokyo Toy Show 1991. Sega was not the only company to talk about CD-ROM-based consoles that day.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Design and Connectivity:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>CD Reading Capability: The primary function of the Mega-CD was to read compact discs, which were becoming an increasingly affordable storage option in the late 1980s and early 1990s.</li>
                        <li>Connection to Mega Drive: The Mega-CD needs to be connected to a Mega Drive console via the expansion port located on the right-hand side of the Mega Drive.</li>
                        <li>Power Requirements: The Mega-CD requires its own AC adapter, meaning that both the Mega Drive and the Mega-CD need separate power sources, occupying two power sockets.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Hardware Enhancements:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Additional Processors and Memory: The Mega-CD includes extra processors, memory, and audio features that enhance the capabilities of the Mega Drive, but these enhancements can only be utilized by software specifically designed for the Mega-CD.</li>
                        <li>Graphics Capabilities: While the Mega-CD adds the ability to scale and rotate sprites, it does not significantly enhance the overall graphical capabilities of the Mega Drive.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Audio Features:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stereo Sound: The Mega-CD provides stereo sound through RCA connectors. While the Mega Drive outputs mono sound to the television, stereo sound is available through the headphone port on the front of the console. By connecting the Mega Drive to the Mega-CD, all games can play in stereo through the television.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Additional Functions:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Compatibility with Sega 32X: The Mega-CD can be used with the Sega 32X add-on to play the six available Sega Mega-CD 32X games.</li>
                        <li>CD Playback: The Mega-CD can play regular 5-inch or 3-inch audio CDs and CD+G discs. It can function as a CD player without a television, as the audio can be controlled using button combinations on the Mega Drive.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="experience-section-content sega32X">
                    <h2>SEGA 32X</h2>
                    <p>
                        Sega Mega-CD performed worst as intended, so they quickly had to recover the lead that they were winning thanks to the Mega Drive. The SEGA 32X was primarily envisioned as a system which would extend the SEGA Mega Drive and provide a slow grow of the Sega Saturn.
                        The 32X didn’t go well in Japan due to the awkward release schedule. Even so, the console had a great start in Europe, earning more than one million orders, but not enough were produced.


                    </p>
                    <h3>Design and Connectivity:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Physical Design: The 32X is a large, heavy, "mushroom-shaped" unit that plugs into the Mega Drive's cartridge slot. It comes with a plastic spacer to ensure a snug fit in most versions of the Mega Drive console.</li>
                        <li>Dual Functionality: The 32X acts as both a means to play specialized 32X cartridges and a passthrough device allowing standard Mega Drive games to be played.</li>
                        <li>Dependencies: Like the Mega-CD, the 32X cannot function as an independent unit and requires a powered Mega Drive to operate. It also requires its own AC adapter, and an additional connection to the Mega Drive console via a unique 32X Connector Cable</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Power and Connections:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Multiple Power Adapters: If a user has both a 32X and a Mega-CD connected to their Mega Drive, they will need three separate power adapters, plus one for the television, making a total of four power adapters.</li>
                        <li>Unique Cables: The 32X uses a bespoke AC adapter similar to the Mega Drive 2 adapter and a unique connector cable, which was not sold separately but has third-party variants available.</li>
                        <li>Sega Power Strip: To address the issue of bulky adapters obstructing surrounding sockets, Sega released a dedicated Sega Power Strip in North America.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Hardware Enhancements:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Visual Upgrades: The 32X includes a VDP (Video Display Processor) that allows the Mega Drive to display up to 32,768 colors on-screen, significantly more than the usual 64 colors in standard Mega Drive titles. It also enhances 2D sprite rendering and supports 2D scaling, rotation, and texture-mapped 3D graphics.</li>
                        <li>Processors: The 32X adds two Hitachi SH-2 32-bit RISC processors, the same type used in the Sega Saturn, to handle the additional graphical and computational demands.</li>
                        <li>Audio Enhancements: The 32X includes a PWM audio chip for extra sound channels and QSound technology, which enables multidimensional sound similar to binaural recording. This enhances the audio experience by approximating 3D sounds through a regular stereo setup.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Compatibility and Limitations:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sega Mega-CD Compatibility: The 32X is compatible with the Sega Mega-CD, allowing users to play enhanced Sega Mega-CD 32X games. This combination enables higher quality full motion video (FMV) with a wider color palette than standard Mega-CD games.</li>
                        <li>Region Locking: The 32X does not have regional lockout technology but relies on the Mega Drive's region to determine compatibility. It uses a Genlock frequency to differentiate between 50Hz (PAL) and 60Hz (NTSC) games, which means Japanese and Genesis 32X units are identical and can work on any NTSC console. Region modifications can be easily made for universal game support.</li>
                    </ul>
